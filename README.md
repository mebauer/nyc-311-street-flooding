# Introduction

Flooding poses a serious threat to coastal cities all around the world, and New York City is no exception. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 devastated the area, with many communities still suffering from its effects or unable to fully recover.  What can citizen science data tell us about where flooding occurs and how it is changing over time? Additionally, how can this data potentially play a role in how New York City prepares and ultimately mitigates flooding in the future?  

In this project, I explored NYC's 311 street flooding complaints data. Specifically, I attempted to answer the following questions:
1. The distribution of street flooding complaints throughout the five boroughs  
2. How street flooding complaints are changing over time  
3. Analyzing street flooding complaints by street  
3. Case studies from Midland Beach, Staten Island and Arverne, Queens
